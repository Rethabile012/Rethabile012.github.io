# Virtual CV
This website features all of the work I have completed throughout the years, as well as my experience, skills, education, and certifications. My virtual resume includes all of my previous work as well as what I'm now working on. There are different sections on it. The names of the sections are projects, about me, contact information, education, experience and skills. It also has a hyperlink for my GitHub and LinkedIn. The links will take straight to the accounts. All the buttons will take to the relevant sections if you click on them. The information is well explained
